# Invoice Manager

App for managing invoices that has a PWA and was made with the use of T3 stack. I used the Frontend Mentor design and enriched it with additional features.

I'm using a free SendGrid license, so if logging via email or sending a pdf isn’t working, it’s probably due to the SendGrid’s limit which resets every 24 hrs. Sorry for the inconvenience.
